# Benchmakrks

Here are my experiments with some high performance code in C++. Main target is to learn how high performance and  multithreading application should be implemented. What are do's and don'ts. How to analyse debug and performance logs to find problems and errors.

## Environment

Benchmarks and analyse are performed using linux operating system on different system architecture x86_64 and ARM. Results of analyse should be the similar between various operating system, Linux or Windows, because it is defined by hardware architecture not software.

I will be using mainly google benchmark library to run code because it was designed to do such job.
